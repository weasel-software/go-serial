# go.bug.st/serial

A cross-platform serial library for go-lang.

## Documentation and examples

See the godoc here: https://godoc.org/go.bug.st/serial

## go.mod transition

This library now support `go.mod` with the import `github.com/weasel-software/go-serial`.

If you came from the pre-`go.mod` era please update your import paths from `github.com/weasel-software/go-serial.v1` to `github.com/weasel-software/go-serial` to receive new updates. Anyway, the latest `v1` release should still be avaiable using the old import.
